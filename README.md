# TDLOG Project : Compatibility Finder

Our project is to create a website allowing people with the same interests to meet.

There are 3 python files :

- routes.py with all the routes of the website
- functions.py with the functions used in routes.py
- models.py with:
  - our two databases : users, with the informations linked to the users; and Message, with all the messages exchanged between the users. Both databases are linked. 
  - other classes, mainly forms
